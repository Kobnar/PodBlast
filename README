# PodBlast

PodBlast is a simple podcast feed tracker written in Python using a GTK/Glade
front-end interface. It was designed to be lightweight and simple, allowing
users to subscribe and listen to their favorite feeds.

## Dependencies

PodBlast was developed on Gentoo with the following dependencies:

 * **Python v.3** (python-3.4) - Everybody's favorite scripting language
 * **GTK+ v.3** (gtk+-3.12.2) - The Gnome Toolkit (a GUI library)
 * **GStreamer v.1** (gstreamer-1.2.4-r2) - A robust media handling library
 * **PyGObject** (pygobject-3.12.2) - GTK+ v.3 bindings for Python v.3
 * **GStreamer** (gst-python-1.2.1) - Gstreamer v.1 bindings for Python v.3

PodBlast also takes advantage of the following Python libraries:

 * **GObject** (gi) to fetch 'Gst' and 'Gtk' libraries in Python 3,
 * **System** (sys) to close the program,
 * **Regex** (re) to parse and verify URLs,
 * **Time** (time) to prase and convert time and zone information,
 * **FeedParser** (feedparser) to fetch and parse remote RSS feeds, and
 * **JSON** (json) to save and load user data.

## Running PodBlast

PodBlast was primarily developed using Gentoo GNU/Linux with some work performed
on Mac OS X (10.9.5). It will therefore undoubtedly run best on GNU/Linux
provided that its dependencies are met. If that is the case, in order to run
PodBlast you should only have to use the bash script ("podblast") located in the
root directory of the program (also called "podblast").

### OS X

**NOTE: PodBlast does not work on OSX yet.##

Because PodBlast was written as a native GNU/Linux application, special steps
are necissary to get it running in OSX.

First, we need to install Homebrew (a package manager) and XQuartz (an
application which allows us to run GUIs made for GNU/Linux and the X11 window
rendering system). Once these two dependencies are installed, the following
two commands *should* get you up and running:

    $ brew install python3 pygobject3 gstreamer gst-python gtk+3
    $ pip3 install feedparser

And maybe these:

    $ pip3 install PyGObject

## Compatibility Notes

Due to the fact that PodBlast requires Python 3, certain compatibility issues
exist. Of specific note is the workaround to remove 'drv_libxml2' from the
preferred XML parsers list in 'FeedParser'. This should have no notable effect
on PodCast's performance.

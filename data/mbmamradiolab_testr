Leave doubt in the dust! Be a better sniper!\u00a0Could you do all that and more with just a zap to the noggin? Maybe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sally Adee, an editor at <em>New Scientist</em>, was at a conference for DARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - when she heard about a way to speed up learning with something\u00a0called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple years later, Sally\u00a0found herself\u00a0weilding\u00a0an M4 assualt rifle, picking off enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. Of course, it was a simulation,\u00a0but Sally's sniper skills made\u00a0producer Soren Wheeler wonder what we should think\u00a0of the\u00a0world of brain stimulation.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the last couple years, tDCS has been all over the news. Researchers claim that juicing the brain with\u00a0just 2 milliamps (think 9-volt battery) can help with everything from learning languages, to quitting smoking, to overcoming depression. We bring\u00a0Michael Weisend, neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, into the studio to tell us how it works\u00a0(Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz of the University of British Columbia help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to Radioshack can make their own brain zapper. And finally, Sally tells us about the unexpected after-effects of a day of super-charged sniper training and makes us wonder about world where you can order up a state of mind.</p><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/radiolab/~4/h_HtJrwrSKE\" width=\"1\" />"}, {"is_new": true, "downloaded": false, "url": "http://feeds.wnyc.org/~r/radiolab/~3/03okJ4SZ0WU/", "title": "Galapagos", "dtg_published": {"tm_min": 58, "tm_hour": 21, "tm_year": 2014, "tm_mday": 17, "tm_yday": 198, "tm_sec": 9, "tm_isdst": 0, "tm_wday": 3, "tm_mon": 7}, "media": ["http://feeds.wnyc.org/~r/radiolab/~5/fMIQmcOmcJA/radiolab071814.mp3"], "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Today, the strange story of a small group of islands that raise a big question: is it inevitable that even our most sacred natural landscapes will eventually get swallowed up by humans?
